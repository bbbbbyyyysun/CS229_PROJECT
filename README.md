# CS229_PROJECT
This is the course project for Stanford CS229. We plan to do the traffic sign detection and classification task with different machine learning and deep learning techniques such as SVM, random forest, CNN, YOLO, Capsule Network. 

We will also combine yolo and capsule network to form a new end-to-end traffice sign classification system.
